** Key Takeaway
[1-2 sentences: What did you learn? What would you recommend?]

** Session Files
Claude Code saves sessions automatically to: =~/.claude/projects/[project-path-with-hyphens]/UUID.jsonl=
- Project paths have slashes converted to hyphens (e.g., =/home/user/repos/agent-experiments= becomes =~/.claude/projects/-home-user-repos-agent-experiments/=)
- On some systems, =XDG_CONFIG_DIR/claude/projects= is used instead of =~/.claude=
- Use =/status= during a session to get the UUID

- Session 1 UUID: [paste UUID here]
- Session 2 UUID: [paste UUID here]
