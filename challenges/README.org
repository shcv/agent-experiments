#+TITLE: Challenges Directory

* Overview

This directory contains documented challenges and issues we've encountered with LLM agents, particularly Claude Code. Each subdirectory represents a category of challenges, with specific reproducible test cases.

* Challenge Categories

** direction-following/
Challenges where Claude doesn't follow explicit instructions correctly.
- Ignoring constraints
- Partial task completion  
- Misinterpreting requirements

** error-patterns/
Common error patterns and failure modes.
- Syntax errors in generated code
- Logic errors
- Import/dependency issues

** complex-refactoring/
Challenges with multi-file, architectural changes.
- Maintaining consistency across files
- Understanding project structure
- Preserving functionality during refactoring

** context-management/
Issues related to context window and memory.
- Forgetting earlier instructions
- Context overflow behavior
- Information prioritization

** tool-usage/
Problems with Claude's tool use.
- Inefficient tool selection
- Incorrect parameter usage
- Tool chaining issues

** multi-step-tasks/
Challenges with tasks requiring multiple steps.
- Step skipping
- Order dependencies
- State management between steps

* Challenge Format

Each challenge should include:

** README.org
- Clear problem description
- Reproduction steps
- Success criteria
- Failure indicators
- Related research/issues

** examples/
- Concrete instances of the challenge
- Minimal reproducible examples
- Both failing and successful cases (if any)

** metrics.org  
- How to measure this challenge
- Baseline performance data
- Improvement tracking

* Contributing a Challenge

1. Create a new directory in the appropriate category
2. Follow the challenge format above
3. Include at least one reproducible example
4. Document any workarounds discovered
5. Link to related experiments

* Using Challenges

Challenges serve as:
- Test cases for new methods
- Benchmarks for improvements
- Documentation of known issues
- Starting points for experiments

See [[../docs/best-practices.org][Best Practices]] for guidance on working with challenges.
