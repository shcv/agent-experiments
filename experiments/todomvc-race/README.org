#+title: TodoMVC Race

* Overview
This is just a first attempt at making *something* like an experiment.
Once we actually do something, we can start improving.

* Concept
This is a 'race' style experiment, as described in [[../../docs/evaluation-methods.org][Evaluation Methods]].

The goal is to complete the spec in the least amount of time.

This could be run as a single experiment, where the methods are tried in parallel, but it could also be done as a time trial competition with a leaderboard, where competitors can submit their session logs.

* Resources
- TodoMVC spec
- submission script?
- automated tests?
- tool for computing results from session logs?

* Instructions
1. Run claude code in ~workspace~
2. Implement the spec in testbeds/todomvc
3. Add session log file from ~/.claude/projects to logs directory
4. Profit?
