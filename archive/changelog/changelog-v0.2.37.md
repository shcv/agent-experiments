# Changelog for version 0.2.37

## Claude Code v0.2.37 Changelog

### New Features

#### ðŸŽ‰ `/release-notes` Command
A new slash command that displays release notes for all versions of Claude Code.

**Usage:**
```bash
/release-notes
```

This command shows the complete release history with version numbers and their corresponding changes. The release notes are now always available and enabled by default (`isEnabled: !0`), replacing the previous version-specific implementation.

#### ðŸ”§ Enhanced `config add/remove` Commands
The `claude config add` and `claude config remove` commands now support adding or removing multiple values at once.

**New capabilities:**
- Add multiple values to array-based configuration options in a single command
- Values can be separated by commas or spaces
- The command now tracks the count of items being added/removed
- Items are automatically deduplicated using Set operations
- Lists are sorted alphabetically after modifications

**Examples:**
```bash
# Add multiple tools to allowed tools
claude config add allowedTools Read,Write,Edit

# Remove multiple patterns from ignore patterns  
claude config remove ignorePatterns "*.log" "*.tmp" "build/"

# Works with both global and project configs
claude config add --global mcpServers server1,server2,server3
```

### Improvements

#### ðŸ”” Kitty Terminal Notification Support
Added native notification support for Kitty terminal emulator using the OSC 99 protocol.

**How it works:**
- When using Kitty terminal, Claude Code can now send desktop notifications
- Notifications include both title and body text
- Automatically detected when `preferredNotifChannel` is set to "auto"
- Can be explicitly enabled with `claude config set preferredNotifChannel kitty`

#### ðŸŽ¯ Better Terminal Detection
