## Claude Code v0.2.93 Changelog

### Removed Features

#### Settings Management Functions Removed
- **Removed local and project settings functionality**
  - Removed `Qs4()` function that returned the project settings path (`.claude/settings.json`)
  - Removed `cy0()` function that handled both managed and project settings
  - Removed `bO1()` function that saved settings to files
  - Removed `R76()` function that managed allowed/denied tool rules based on local settings
  - Removed `Fp5()` function that displayed settings information

This indicates that the settings management system has been refactored or removed entirely in this version.

#### Todo List Read Functionality Removed
- **Removed the `TodoRead` tool description and implementation**
  - The tool that allowed reading the current todo list for the session has been removed
  - This tool previously allowed checking task status without parameters
  - The related UI component `n76()` for rendering todo lists has also been removed

### Added Features

#### React/UI Framework Integration
A significant number of React-related functions have been added, suggesting a major UI framework update or integration:

- **Core React Functions**: Added fundamental React utilities like `S2()` for error handling, `eT()`, `Ex()` for event handling
- **DOM Manipulation**: Added functions for DOM operations including `jx1()`, `bl()`, `cl()` for element manipulation
- **Component Lifecycle**: Added hooks and lifecycle management functions
- **Event System**: Enhanced event handling with functions like `Ji()`, `rY9()`, `tY9()`, `eY9()`
- **Rendering Pipeline**: Added numerous rendering-related functions for component updates and reconciliation

#### Enhanced Development Tools
- **Error Boundaries**: Added error handling capabilities with functions like `Zr0()`, `Gr0()` for better error management
- **Performance Monitoring**: Added functions for tracking component render times and performance metrics
- **State Management**: Enhanced state management with functions like `Va0()`, `Mi()`, `DZ1()` for hooks implementation

### Technical Improvements

#### Internal Architecture Updates
- Significant restructuring of the internal architecture with 487 new function additions
- The high structural similarity (92.8%) indicates these are primarily additions rather than replacements
- Most of the new code appears to be React/UI framework related, suggesting a major UI system upgrade

### Breaking Changes
- The removal of the settings management system (`localSettings` and `projectSettings`) may break existing workflows that relied on these features
- The removal of the `TodoRead` tool means users can no longer query their todo list status programmatically

### Migration Notes
- Users who relied on local or project settings files (`.claude/settings.json`) will need to adapt to the new configuration system
- The todo list functionality appears to have been streamlined - reading todos may now be integrated differently or removed in favor of a write-only approach
