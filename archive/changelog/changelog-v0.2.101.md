export ANTHROPIC_MODEL="claude-3-7-sonnet"
claude "Help me write a Python script"

# The CLI will use Claude 3.7 Sonnet for this request
```

#### Using platform-specific routing:
```bash
# For AWS Bedrock
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_BEDROCK=true
claude "Analyze this codebase"

# For Google Cloud Vertex
export CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=true
claude "Review this pull request"
```

The model selection interface provides clear pricing information and performance characteristics to help users choose the most appropriate model for their needs.
