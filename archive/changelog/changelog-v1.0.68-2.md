## Claude Code v1.0.68 Changelog

### Major Changes

#### üöÄ Enhanced Process Execution System
- **New subprocess handling architecture**: Complete overhaul of how Claude Code executes commands and processes
  - Improved process spawning with better error handling and resource management
  - Added support for advanced IPC (Inter-Process Communication) features
  - New streaming capabilities for subprocess I/O with proper backpressure handling
  
#### üîß Improved Command Execution
- **Better command parsing and escaping**: Enhanced security and reliability when executing shell commands
  - Automatic escaping of special characters in commands
  - Improved handling of command arguments with spaces and special characters
  - Better error messages showing both the original and escaped commands

#### üìù Process Communication Features
- **Advanced IPC support**: New capabilities for bidirectional communication with subprocesses
  - Support for structured clone serialization (default) and JSON serialization
  - Graceful cancellation of running processes with proper signal handling
  - New `ipcInput` option to send initial data to subprocess on startup
  - Deadlock detection and prevention in IPC communications

### New Features

#### üé® Enhanced Terminal Output
- **Colored output support**: Added comprehensive ANSI color code support for better terminal visualization
  - Support for bold, italic, underline, and various color combinations
  - Smart color detection based on terminal capabilities
  - New formatting functions for error messages, warnings, and success indicators

#### ‚ö° Performance Improvements
- **Concurrent stream handling**: Better performance when dealing with multiple I/O streams
  - Improved buffering strategies for large outputs
  - More efficient memory usage with streaming operations
  - Better handling of binary data in subprocess communications

#### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling Enhancements
- **More detailed error information**: Enhanced error reporting for failed commands
  - Shows command duration and timing information
  - Better distinction between different types of failures (timeout, signal, graceful cancel)
  - Improved error messages for common issues like missing files or invalid options

### API Improvements

#### üìä New Options and Configuration
- **Timeout handling**: Improved timeout configuration with clearer error messages
  ```bash
  # Commands now show detailed timeout information
  # "Command timed out after X milliseconds"
  ```

- **Graceful cancellation**: New `gracefulCancel` option for subprocess management
  ```bash
  # Processes can now be cancelled gracefully, allowing them to clean up
  # before termination
  ```

- **Verbose output modes**: Enhanced verbose output with multiple levels
  - `none`: No verbose output
  - `short`: Basic command execution info
  - `full`: Detailed execution logs with timing
  - Custom function support for advanced logging

### Bug Fixes

#### üêõ Removed Features
- **Removed NotebookRead tool**: The separate NotebookRead functionality has been removed and integrated into the main Read tool
  - Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) are now handled automatically by the Read tool
  - Better integration with the existing file reading infrastructure

#### üîÑ Process Management Fixes
- Fixed race conditions in subprocess termination
- Improved cleanup of file descriptors and streams
- Better handling of zombie processes
- Fixed memory leaks in long-running operations

### Developer Experience

#### üîç Better Debugging
- **Enhanced command visibility**: All executed commands now show both raw and escaped versions
- **Timing information**: Each command execution includes detailed timing metrics
- **Stream inspection**: Better tools for debugging I/O stream issues

#### üìö Improved Error Messages
- Clearer error messages for common configuration mistakes
- Better suggestions for fixing issues
- More context in error stack traces

### Internal Improvements

#### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Changes
- Modularized subprocess handling code for better maintainability
- Improved separation of concerns between command parsing, execution, and result handling
- Better abstraction for cross-platform compatibility

#### üß™ Testing Infrastructure
- Added comprehensive tests for new subprocess features
- Better coverage for edge cases in command execution
- Improved integration tests for IPC functionality

### Breaking Changes

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: While most changes are backward compatible, there are a few breaking changes:

1. The `signal` option has been renamed to `cancelSignal` for clarity
2. The `verbose: true/false` options have been replaced with string values (`'none'`, `'short'`, `'full'`)
3. The separate NotebookRead tool no longer exists - use the standard Read tool instead

### Summary

Version 1.0.68 represents a significant improvement in Claude Code's subprocess and command execution capabilities. The focus has been on reliability, performance, and developer experience, with particular attention to error handling and process communication. These changes make Claude Code more robust when executing system commands and interacting with external processes.
