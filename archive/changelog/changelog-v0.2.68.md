## Changes

### Import Optimizations

This release includes minor import optimizations that improve code efficiency:

- **Stream module**: Changed from importing the entire `stream` module to importing only the `PassThrough` class that's actually used
  - Before: `import sy4 from "stream"`
  - After: `import { PassThrough as a69 } from "stream"`

- **Process module**: Changed from importing the entire `node:process` module to importing only the `cwd` function that's needed
  - Before: `import gs2 from "node:process"`  
  - After: `import { cwd as kJ0 } from "node:process"`

These changes follow JavaScript best practices by importing only the specific functions/classes needed rather than entire modules. This can lead to:
- Smaller bundle sizes
- Faster startup times
- More explicit code dependencies

### Internal Refactoring

- 191 internal renames were performed, likely part of the minification/obfuscation process
- Overall structural similarity remains at 100% - no functional changes to the CLI behavior

## Summary

Version 0.2.68 is a minor maintenance release focused on import optimizations. There are no new features, commands, or user-facing changes. The CLI functionality remains identical to v0.2.67.
