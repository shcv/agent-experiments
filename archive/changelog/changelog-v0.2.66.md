# Changelog for version 0.2.66

# Claude Code v0.2.66 Changelog

## New Features

### Todo List Management Tools
Added comprehensive todo list functionality with two new tools:

**TodoWrite** - Update and manage your task list during coding sessions
- Create, update, and track todos with status (pending, in_progress, completed) and priority (high, medium, low)
- Automatic progress tracking with visual indicators
- Use it to organize complex multi-step tasks and maintain focus

**TodoRead** - View your current todo list
- Quickly check pending tasks and current progress
- Shows focused view by default, with verbose option for full list
- Helps maintain context across long coding sessions

Example usage:
```
# Claude will proactively use these tools to track progress
# You can also explicitly ask to see or update the todo list
"Show me my todo list"
"Add a todo to implement dark mode"
```
