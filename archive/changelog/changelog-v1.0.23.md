# Changelog for version 1.0.23

## Claude Code v1.0.23 Changelog

### New Features

#### ðŸ†• Add Directory Command (`/add-dir`)
A new command has been added to dynamically add working directories during your session:

```bash
/add-dir <path>
```

**Usage Examples:**
- `/add-dir ../my-project` - Adds a relative path as a working directory
- `/add-dir /home/user/projects` - Adds an absolute path as a working directory

**Features:**
- Validates that the path exists and is a directory
- Prevents adding directories that are already accessible within existing working directories
- Provides helpful error messages if you accidentally specify a file instead of a directory

#### ðŸ”§ Enhanced MCP Server Management UI
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server management interface has been completely redesigned with improved visual indicators:

- **Connection Status Icons**: 
  - âœ“ Connected (green checkmark)
  - â—‹ Connecting... (gray radio button)
  - â–² Disconnected/Needs authentication (yellow warning triangle)
  - âœ— Failed (red cross)

- **Server Capabilities Display**: Shows available capabilities (tools, resources, prompts) for each server

- **Streamlined Authentication Flow**: 
  - Automatic authentication prompts when needed
  - Re-authentication and clear authentication options
  - Better error handling and status feedback

### Improvements

#### ðŸš€ Native Binary Installation
- Switched from npm-based installation to direct binary downloads from Google Cloud Storage
- Improved platform detection supporting Windows (x64), macOS (x64/arm64), and Linux (x64/arm64)
- Added checksum verification for downloaded binaries
- More reliable update mechanism with atomic symlink updates

#### ðŸ“Š File Reading Enhancements
- New token-based limits for file reading with clearer error messages
