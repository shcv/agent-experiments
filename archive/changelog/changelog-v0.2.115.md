# Changelog for version 0.2.115

## Claude Code v0.2.115 Changelog

### New Features

#### **Automatic Git Command Optimization**
Git commands executed through Claude Code now run significantly faster with automatic performance optimizations:
- Disables interactive prompts that could hang the process
- Removes file locking overhead for better performance
- Disables automatic maintenance and file system monitoring
- Clears credential helpers to prevent authentication delays

**Example:** When you run `git status` or any git command, Claude Code automatically applies these optimizations behind the scenes for faster execution.

#### **Custom Notification Commands**
You can now configure custom commands to run when Claude Code sends notifications:
- Set `customNotifyCommand` in your configuration to execute any script or command
- Receives notification title and message as parameters
- Perfect for integrating with system notification tools, logging systems, or custom workflows

**Example configuration:**
```json
{
  "customNotifyCommand": "/path/to/your/notification-script.sh"
}
```
