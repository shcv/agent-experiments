## Summary

Version 0.2.48 is a maintenance release focused on internal code organization. The changes involve switching from default imports to named imports for Node.js built-in modules, which is a best practice for better tree-shaking and clearer code intentions. These changes do not affect any user-facing functionality, CLI arguments, or interactive features.
