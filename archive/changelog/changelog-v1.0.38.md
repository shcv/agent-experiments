{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "file_edit|str_replace",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "echo 'About to edit a file' | tee -a /tmp/claude.log"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

New Grep tool usage examples:
```bash
# Search for function definitions
claude> Search for "function.*Error" in all JavaScript files

# Multiline search for struct definitions
claude> Search for struct definitions with a "field" property using multiline mode

# Count occurrences with context
claude> Count how many times "TODO" appears in the codebase with 2 lines of context
```
