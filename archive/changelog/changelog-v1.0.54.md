## New Features

### üöÄ Dynamic OAuth Callback Port Configuration
- **Added environment variable support for OAuth callbacks**: You can now set `MCP_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT` to specify a custom OAuth callback port

  export MCP_OAUTH_CALLBACK_PORT=45000
  claude-code
  ```

### üìÅ Enhanced File System Monitoring

- **Settings change detection**: Automatically detects when settings files are modified externally and can reload configurations
- **Improved performance**: Better handling of file system events with debouncing and throttling

### üîß Settings Configuration Improvements
- **Better validation messages**: Settings file validation now provides more descriptive error messages with specific field names
- **Schema documentation**: All settings fields now include helpful descriptions in the schema

### üêö Shell Environment Improvements  
- **Simplified shell snapshots**: Shell environment capture now outputs directly to stdout instead of writing temporary files
- **Debug mode support**: When `CLAUDE_CODE_DEBUG` is set, shell snapshots are saved to disk for troubleshooting
