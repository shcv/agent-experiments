# Changelog for version 0.2.52

## Claude Code v0.2.52 Changelog

### Summary
Version 0.2.52 includes minor internal refactoring with no user-facing changes. The update focuses on improving import specificity for better code organization.

### Internal Changes

#### Import Optimizations
- **Refined stream module imports**: Changed from importing the entire `stream` module to specifically importing only the `Readable` class. This improves bundle size and load times.
  ```javascript
  // Before: import BM4 from "stream";
  // After: import { Readable as tE4 } from "stream";
  ```

- **Refined process module imports**: Changed from importing the entire `node:process` module to specifically importing only the `cwd` function. This follows Node.js best practices for named imports.
  ```javascript
  // Before: import gc2 from "node:process";
  // After: import { cwd as GV0 } from "node:process";
  ```

### Technical Details
- **Structural similarity**: 100% - No architectural changes
- **Code stability**: High - Only 2 import statements modified out of 5,923 declarations
- **Performance impact**: Minor improvement in module loading efficiency

### Notes
This is a maintenance release with no new features, bug fixes, or breaking changes. The import refinements are part of ongoing code quality improvements but have no impact on CLI functionality or user experience.
