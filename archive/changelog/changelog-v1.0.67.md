# Changelog for version 1.0.67

## Claude Code v1.0.67 Changelog

### Import Optimizations

**Improved module imports for better performance and specificity:**

- **Stream module imports refined**: Instead of importing entire `stream` and `node:stream` modules, the new version only imports the specific `PassThrough` class that's needed:
  ```javascript
  // Before:
  import qe0 from "node:stream";
  import ZR9 from "stream";
  
  // After:
  import { PassThrough as KT6 } from "node:stream";
  import { PassThrough as GY8 } from "stream";
  ```

- **Process module import optimized**: Changed from importing the entire `node:process` module to only importing the `cwd` function:
  ```javascript
  // Before:
  import rgB from "node:process";
  
  // After:
  import { cwd as Nt0 } from "node:process";
  ```

### Error Handling Improvements

**Simplified error path extraction logic:**

The error path extraction function has been streamlined to remove unnecessary code for handling unrecognized keys:

```javascript
// Before: Handled special case for 'unrecognized_keys' errors
function X3Q(A) {
  if (A.length === 0) return "unknown";
  let B = A[0];
  if (!B) return "unknown";
  if (B.path.length > 0) return B.path.join(".");
  if (B.code === "unrecognized_keys" && "keys" in B) {
    let Q = B.keys;
    return Q.length > 0 ? (Q[0] ?? "unknown") : "unknown";
  }
  return "unknown";
}

// After: Simplified logic without special case handling
function X3Q(A) {
  if (A.length === 0) return "unknown";
  let B = A[0];
  if (!B) return "unknown";
  if (B.path.length > 0) return B.path.join(".");
  return "unknown";
}
```

### Summary

This update focuses on performance optimizations through more targeted imports and cleaner error handling logic. The changes reduce memory footprint by importing only the specific functions needed rather than entire modules, and simplify the codebase by removing unnecessary special case handling in error path extraction.
