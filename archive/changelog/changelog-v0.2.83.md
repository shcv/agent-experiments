# Changelog for version 0.2.83

Based on my analysis of the diff between versions 0.2.81 and 0.2.83, here is the changelog:

## Claude Code v0.2.83 Changelog

### Version Update
- Updated from version 0.2.81 to 0.2.83

### Internal Architecture Changes

#### Dependency Updates
- **Removed legacy polyfills**: Removed Microsoft tslib polyfills (Vj1) and several older semver-related modules (ti, XY1)
- **Added ES module introspection utilities**: New low-level JavaScript runtime introspection modules for better error handling and type checking
- **Enhanced runtime environment detection**: Added comprehensive checks for JavaScript built-in objects and methods

#### JSON Schema Processing Enhancements
- **New schema validation options**:
  - Added `allowedAdditionalProperties` configuration option (default: true)
  - Added `rejectedAdditionalProperties` configuration option (default: false)
  - These options provide finer control over how additional properties in JSON schemas are handled during validation
- **Post-processing support**: Added `postProcess` callback support in the JSON schema generation pipeline, allowing for custom transformations after schema generation

#### Tool System Improvements
- **Removed deprecated todo tool**: The internal `tengu_todo_tool` reference has been removed from the codebase
- **Enhanced error handling**: Improved type checking for tool parameters with better runtime validation

#### Event Stream Processing
- **Improved SSE parser**: Enhanced Server-Sent Events parser with better error handling and support for BOM (Byte Order Mark) detection
- **Added stream reset options**: New `consume` parameter in the reset function for better stream state management

#### Performance and Stability
- **Code simplification**: Removed approximately 44 deprecated functions while adding 473 new utility functions
- **Better type safety**: Enhanced runtime type checking with new introspection utilities
- **Improved error messages**: More descriptive error reporting with enhanced type validation

### User-Facing Improvements
While most changes in this version are internal architecture improvements, users should experience:
- More stable tool execution with better error handling
- Improved reliability when working with complex data structures
- Better performance in JSON schema validation scenarios

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues with additional properties handling in JSON schema validation
- Improved stream processing reliability with better state management
- Enhanced type checking to prevent runtime errors

**Note**: This version focuses primarily on internal architecture improvements and stability enhancements rather than new user-facing features.
