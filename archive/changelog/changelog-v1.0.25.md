### 🛠️ Improved PATH Configuration
- **Better PATH setup for ~/.local/bin**: Enhanced the installation process to properly configure PATH

  - Example output: "Added ~/.local/bin to PATH in ~/.zshrc. You may need to restart your shell or run: source ~/.zshrc"

### 📄 Custom Command Enhancements
- **Frontmatter parsing**: Custom commands now support YAML-style frontmatter in markdown files
  ```markdown
  ---
  title: My Command
  description: Does something useful
  ---
  
  Command content here...
  ```

- **Inline bash execution**: Execute bash commands directly within custom command markdown
  - Block syntax: ` ```!echo "Hello from command"``` `
  - Inline syntax: `` !`date` ``
  - Commands are validated and executed with proper permissions
  - Output is inserted directly into the rendered content

### 🎯 Better Output Formatting
- **Improved line wrapping**: Long lines in output are now properly wrapped at terminal width boundaries
- **Enhanced truncation display**: When output is truncated, shows more accurate line counts

## Bug Fixes

### 🔧 Version Parsing
- Added robust version string parsing to handle edge cases in version comparisons

## Internal Improvements

### 🏗️ Code Organization
- Modularized color inversion logic for better theme support
- Improved git repository root detection with fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced custom command discovery to check both global and project-local directories

### 📊 Analytics
- Added "command" to tracked context types for better usage insights

## Usage Examples

### Managing Workspace Directories
```bash
# In Claude Code, navigate to permissions
# Select the "Workspace" tab
# Choose "Add directory..."
# Enter: /home/user/my-project
# Claude can now read and edit files in that directory
```

### Using Custom Commands with Bash Execution
Create a custom command file with inline bash:
```markdown
---
title: System Info
description: Shows current system information
---

Current user: !`whoami`
Current directory: !`pwd`

System details:
```!
uname -a
df -h
```
```

The bash commands will execute when the custom command is invoked, with output inserted into the response.
