#+TITLE: Claude Code Thinking Keywords and Token Budgets Investigation
#+DATE: 2025-07-26

* Overview

This document records the findings from investigating the thinking keywords and token budgets in the =cli-pretty-v1.0.61-core.js= file from Claude Code.

* Token Budgets

The thinking levels have the following token budgets defined in the =gb1= object:

| Level   | Token Budget | Notes    |
|---------+--------------+----------|
| HIGHEST | 31999        |          |
| MIDDLE  | 10000        | (1e4)    |
| BASIC   | 4000         |          |
| NONE    | 0            |          |

* Thinking Keywords by Language

The keywords are organized in the =HX8= object by language and thinking level. The =needsWordBoundary= property (when set to =!0= or =true=) indicates that the pattern requires word boundaries for matching.

* Technical Notes

1. All patterns with =needsWordBoundary: !0= require word boundary matching to prevent false positives within larger words.

2. The NONE level exists for all languages but contains no keywords (empty array).

3. The implementation appears to use these patterns to detect thinking requests in user input and allocate the appropriate token budget for the assistant's thinking process.

4. Special keywords like "ultrathink" (HIGHEST) and "megathink" (MIDDLE) are unique compound words that trigger specific thinking levels in English.
