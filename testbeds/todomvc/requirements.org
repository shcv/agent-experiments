* TodoMVC Functional Requirements

** Core Todo Management
- Add new todo items with text description
- View all todo items in a list
- Mark individual todos as complete/incomplete
- Edit existing todo text inline
- Delete individual todo items

** Bulk Operations
- Mark all todos as complete with single action
- Clear all completed todos at once

** Filtering and Views
- Display all todos (default view)
- Display only active (incomplete) todos
- Display only completed todos
- Show count of active items remaining

** Data Persistence
- Persist todos between page reloads
- Maintain todo state (text, completion status, order)

** User Interface
- Input field for new todos at top of interface
- Individual todo items show checkbox and text
- Strike-through styling for completed items
- Show/hide toggle for completed items editing
- Double-click todo text to edit
- Press Enter to save edits
- Press Escape to cancel edits without saving

** Item Counter
- Display count in format "X item(s) left"
- Use singular "item" for count of 1
- Use plural "items" for all other counts
